# gcsfileserver

Want to serve non-public files off Google Cloud Storage over https to a select group of people?
Then Google Cloud Storage File Server may be for you.

- Uses App Engine to keep costs very low (as long as your request volume is low, which it usually is when serving files to a small group of people)
- Uses Google Cloud Identity Aware Proxy, which lets you specify which Google Apps or gmail emails should have access
- HTTPS provided by App Engine for no added cost
- If you have no requests in a month, your cost is probably $0.00 (excluding Google Cloud Storage costs to store your files)
- Your GCS bucket is not open to the public
- GCS files are read-only through gcsfileserver

Caveat: not intended for very high request rates.  That use case would require implementing caching of some objects to reduce the network round trips to GCS.
**Note:** This relies on Go 1.11. If you want to use a newer version of Go, you need to pull out all the appengine library usage and replace it with the libraries Google AppEngine supports for Go 1.12+ - https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/go-differences

## Setup

1. Set up IAP
2. Optional, set up custom domain in App Engine > Settings.  This gets you free SSL to a custom domain name.
3. Create a app.yaml and specify the GCS bucket you want to serve files from:

        runtime: go111
        
        
        handlers:
        - url: /.*
          script: auto
        
        env_variables:
          BUCKET: "rchapman.appspot.com"
4. Make sure your bucket is created and is not publicly accessible.
5. Find your app engine service account in Google Cloud Console > IAM
   For this example, I'll use mine, rchapman@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
6. In the Google Cloud Console, go to your GCS bucket and give your app engine service account (rchapman@appspot.gserviceaccount.com in the previous example) the roles "Storage Object Viewer" and "Storage Legacy Bucket Reader"
7. Create main.go in the same directory as your app.yaml file:

        package main
        
        import (
            "net/http"
        
            "github.com/ryanchapman/gcsfileserver"
            "google.golang.org/appengine"
        )
        
        func main() {
            s := gcsfileserver.Server{
        	        DirListPageSize: 100,
            }
            http.Handle("/", &s)
            appengine.Main()
        }

8. Deploy the app with `gcloud app deploy --project=YOUR_GCP_PROJECT` (for example `gcloud app deploy --project=rchapman`)
9. Open web browser with `gcloud app browse --project=YOUR_GCP_PROJECT`
